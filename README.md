I've been working with Data Engineering since the beginning of 2021. In this time, I have learnt how to create and maintain Data Pipelines, as well as structure data according to Dimensional Modeling principles.

🔨 Here are some of the tools I'm experienced with:
- Apache Spark
- Apache Airflow
- Apache Kafka
- Databricks
- AWS
- Terraform

♟ I'm also a chess player (not a good one, but I try). Well, why not mix up my skills? I'm currently developing a Data Pipeline to fetch and analyze data from chess games, as a personal project. Here's what I've got so far:
- [the-week-in-chess-python-client](https://github.com/Miller-GS/the-week-in-chess-python-client): A Python client to scrape chess games from the website [The Week in Chess](https://theweekinchess.com/).
- fide-python-client :construction: : A Python client to fetch player data from the [International Chess Federation](https://www.fide.com/)
- [chess-etl](https://github.com/Miller-GS/chess-etl) :construction: : A Data Pipeline that fetches and models chess games and player data, using Apache Airflow and DBT.
